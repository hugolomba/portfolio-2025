The app provides detailed information about the planets in our solar system (including the Sun and Pluto) and allows fun interactions, such as calculating your weight and age on each planet based on gravity and orbital period values from the Solar System API. I also integrated the NASA Image and Video Library to dynamically generate a gallery of space images, making the experience even more immersive.

The design is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes. This project reflects my ability to consume real-world APIs with React, transform data into interactive features, and create user-friendly interfaces that blend learning with exploration.`,

      `# The Solar System

**The Solar System** is an interactive React application I built to practice and improve my skills in working with APIs. I chose this theme because space has always fascinated me, and combining something I enjoy with learning made the development process much more engaging.

In addition to the frontend, I also developed the **Solar System API**: a simple RESTful API that provides information about celestial objects such as planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, and galaxies. The API is built with **Node.js** and **Express**, and it powers the data used in this app.

## Features

- Detailed information about all the planets in our solar system, including the Sun and Pluto.
- Fun interactions to calculate your **weight** and **age** on each planet based on gravity and orbital period values from the **Solar System API**.
- Dynamic image gallery integrated with the **NASA Image and Video Library** for an immersive visual experience.
- Fully responsive design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

This project demonstrates my ability to **consume and build real-world APIs with React and Node.js**, transform data into interactive features, and create **user-friendly interfaces** that combine learning with exploration.`,
