When I started learning React in 2022, I created a small project called The Solar System that displayed basic information about the planets and the Sun. It was simple, but it had a unique touch: it was about something I love, the universe, which motivated me to dive deeper into coding.

Revisiting it now felt like opening a time capsule. I decided to rebuild the entire project from scratch, this time using React + TypeScript + Tailwind for the frontend, and Node.js + Express + TypeScript for the backend, creating my own API to serve the data.

What changed?

Previously, the project only displayed the planets and the Sun. Today, it allows exploration of:
- Dwarf planets
- Asteroids
- Galaxies
- Interesting facts about each celestial body

Additionally, I updated the design with a sci-fi style, added smooth animations, and interactive features that make the experience more engaging.

What I learned and achieved

Rebuilding the project allowed me to review my old code and improve it significantly. I had to consider everything from the API architecture and how the data would be structured to how React components interact with this information.

It was also an opportunity to exercise my full-stack skills:
- Creating and consuming my own API
- Organizing the frontend in a clean and scalable way
- Implementing animations and interactive design

For recruiters or anyone exploring this project, it clearly demonstrates that I can:
- Develop complete solutions from scratch
- Integrate frontend and backend in a functional way
- Create attractive and responsive interfaces
- Turn ideas into fully interactive digital products

In summary, The Solar System is more than a project about planets — it’s a project about learning, evolving, and transforming knowledge into something you can see and interact with.

    title: "Rebuilding the Abduction Game: Leveling Up My JavaScript Skills",
    excerpt: "A complete revamp of my Abduction Game project, turning it into a more interactive and engaging experience using vanilla JavaScript, CSS animations, and modern coding practices.",

When I first created the Abduction Game, it was a simple project that helped me practice basic JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation. The game involved abducting characters with a UFO and keeping track of the score. It was fun, but I knew it had a lot of potential for improvement.

Rebuilding it now was an opportunity to take it to the next level. I rewrote the entire game using modern JavaScript practices, improved animations with CSS, and enhanced the interactivity, making the game smoother and more engaging.

What changed?

- The game now features multiple levels with increasing difficulty
- Improved UFO movement and character animations
- Score tracking with persistent high scores
- A more interactive and visually appealing interface

What I learned and achieved

Rewriting the game pushed me to better structure my code and organize functions for scalability. I also focused on enhancing the user experience through responsive design and smooth animations.

This project showcases my ability to:
- Use vanilla JavaScript effectively for interactive projects
- Structure code in a maintainable and scalable way
- Apply CSS animations to improve user experience
- Turn a small idea into a fun, playable project

In short, the Abduction Game is not just a game — it’s a demonstration of my growth as a developer, my attention to detail, and my ability to create interactive digital experiences from scratch.
