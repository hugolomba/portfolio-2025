When I started learning React in 2022, I created a small project called The Solar System that displayed basic information about the planets and the Sun. It was simple, but it had a unique touch: it was about something I love, the universe, which motivated me to dive deeper into coding.

Revisiting it now felt like opening a time capsule. I decided to rebuild the entire project from scratch, this time using React + TypeScript + Tailwind for the frontend, and Node.js + Express + TypeScript for the backend, creating my own API to serve the data.

What changed?

Previously, the project only displayed the planets and the Sun. Today, it allows exploration of:
- Dwarf planets
- Asteroids
- Galaxies
- Interesting facts about each celestial body

Additionally, I updated the design with a sci-fi style, added smooth animations, and interactive features that make the experience more engaging.

What I learned and achieved

Rebuilding the project allowed me to review my old code and improve it significantly. I had to consider everything from the API architecture and how the data would be structured to how React components interact with this information.

It was also an opportunity to exercise my full-stack skills:
- Creating and consuming my own API
- Organizing the frontend in a clean and scalable way
- Implementing animations and interactive design

For recruiters or anyone exploring this project, it clearly demonstrates that I can:
- Develop complete solutions from scratch
- Integrate frontend and backend in a functional way
- Create attractive and responsive interfaces
- Turn ideas into fully interactive digital products

In summary, The Solar System is more than a project about planets — it’s a project about learning, evolving, and transforming knowledge into something you can see and interact with.
