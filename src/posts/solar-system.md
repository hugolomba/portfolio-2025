## Blog Post â€“ The Solar System: Refactoring a Beloved Project from Scratch

When I first started learning React back in 2022, I created a small project called **The Solar System**.  
It displayed basic information about the planets and the Sun. It was simple, but it had something special: it was about a topic I love â€” the universe â€” and that kept me motivated to go deeper into coding.

Revisiting it now felt like opening a time capsule.  
I decided to rebuild the whole project from scratch, this time with **React + TypeScript + Tailwind** on the frontend, and **Node.js + Express + TypeScript** on the backend, creating my own API to serve the data.

## What Changed?

Previously, the project only displayed the planets and the Sun.  
Now, it allows exploration of:

- Dwarf planets  
- Asteroids  
- Galaxies  
- Interesting facts about each celestial body  

On top of that, I redesigned the UI with a **sci-fi inspired style**, added smooth animations, and made the experience more interactive.

## What I Learned and Achieved

Rebuilding the project gave me the chance to review my old code and improve it significantly.  
I had to think through everything â€” from the **API architecture** and how the data would be structured, to how **React components** would consume and interact with this information.

It was also a great opportunity to exercise my **full-stack skills**:

- Building and consuming my own API  
- Organising the frontend in a clean and scalable way  
- Implementing animations and interactive design

## For Recruiters or Visitors

This project clearly demonstrates my ability to:

- Develop complete solutions from scratch  
- Integrate frontend and backend in a functional way  
- Build responsive and visually appealing interfaces  
- Turn ideas into fully interactive digital products

## Conclusion

In short, **The Solar System** is more than just a project about planets â€” itâ€™s a project about **learning, evolving, and transforming knowledge into something you can see and interact with**.
